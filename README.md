Colombia has a diversity of genres in traditional music, which
allows to express the richness of the Colombian culture according to
the region. This musical diversity is the result of a mixture of African,
native Indigenous, and European influences. Organizing large collections
of songs is a time consuming task that requires that a human listens to
fragments of audio to identify genre, singer, year, instruments and other
relevant characteristics that allow to index the song dataset. This paper
presents a method to automatically identify the genre of a Colombian
song by means of its audio content. The method extracts audio features
that are used to train a machine learning model that learns to classify
the genre. The method was evaluated in a dataset of 180 musical pieces
belonging to six folkloric Colombian music genres: Bambuco, Carranga,
Cumbia, Joropo, Pasillo, and Vallenato. Results show that it is possible
to automatically identify the music genre in spite of the complexity of
Colombian rhythms reaching an average accuracy of 69%.
